# Add support for unit testing 

## What ?

As developer 
    I want to have a proper set-up for running unit tests in the current repository.

## Why ?

- Validate each unit of the software performs as designed


## How ?

1. Investigate which test runner and assert lib we will use for the implementation. 
2. Set-up a test runner
3. Set-up a assert library 
4. Set-up npm commands for testing

### 1 - Investigate which test runner and assert lib we will use for the implementation. 

**Mocha**

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.


**Chai**

Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

**List:**
- mocha
- chai

### 2 - Set-up a test runner (Mocha)


**Install dependencies:**

```
npm install mocha --save-dev

npm install --save-dev chai


```

**NPM test command:**

Now we will able to run mocha cli with npm script defined on the  package.json, so let's add update the npm command `test` with mocha like this:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha **/*.spec.js"
```
