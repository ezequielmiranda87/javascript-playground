# Queue

It's a **FIFO (First-in First-out)** Data structure. Enqueue on one end, and Dequeue from the other end.

The difference between stack and queues is is removing. In a stack we remove the last item added and in queue we remove the least item added. 


## Run consumer example

``
npm run js-run-queue
``

- **front:** return the first element in the queue
