npm run js-run-queue
```

## Advantages
- Not require contiguous blocks of memory.
- Efficient removal of elements (Compared with dynamic arrays).

**Interface:**

- **append:** Add a node at the tail of the linked list
- **prepend** Add a node at the beginning of the list
- **insert** Add a new node in the a specific position in the Linked list
